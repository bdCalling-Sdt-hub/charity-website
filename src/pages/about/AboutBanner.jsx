            Virtue Hope C.I.C. is a UK-based social enterprise committed to
            supporting women survivors of abuse and trauma. In collaboration
            with other organisations, we provide vital respite, art therapy,
            counselling, and emotional support to aid in the journey of healing
            and recovery. As a Community Interest Company, we have no
            shareholders. Every donation and every pound raised is reinvested
            directly into our mission. We are currently fundraising to open our
            first therapeutic wellbeing retreat in Cornwall, which will offer a
            sanctuary of healing, creativity, and support. This retreat will be
            the first of many safe spaces we aim to establish across the UK and
            beyond. To support our mission, we raise funds through a variety of
            purpose-led initiatives
